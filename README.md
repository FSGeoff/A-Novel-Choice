 ## Description
  Looking for your next book to read for your book club, but canâ€™t decide on one. 
  No problem! With A Novel Choice you can decide on a category for the month and 
  have each member add in a suggested book. Once a list of books has been created 
  members can vote for the book they would like to read for the month. The book 
  with the most votes will then be the winner and your book club's next book.
